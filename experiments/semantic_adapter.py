The task contract is fixed: assessment_mode=evidence evaluates what evidence_scope documents say about the

World verification is a separate output, and unknown is allowed. Do not turn agreement between
copies into independent confirmation. Never use model memory as evidence. Keep JSON concise.
"""

PSI_PROMPT = DATA_RULE + """Decompose the CURRENT material, including its negation, times, numbers and scope.
Return only findings grounded in visible exact quotes. Use 0-based end-exclusive spans;
put decisive qualifying phrases in qualifier_spans, and human explanations in qualifiers.
Fragment parent_id is the target id, or a fragment id included in this same response.
Trace visible citations separately from whether they support the target. An unavailable upstream
uses to_version=null, status=declared, upstream_locator=URL. Add a provenance gap with action=fetch
and locator=that URL. Use direct only when the upstream version is present in context.materials.
Each relation basis needs a from_version quote. Original findings need a quote from that record
identifying its publishing role; a URL named record is insufficient. Originality does not prove truth.
Revisit a DIFFERENT prior version only if new material changes its interpretation. Never revisit
the current version or repeat a previously resolved dependency without a new basis.
Each gap names target_id, dimension, action, locator and decision_impact. Use fetch for URLs,
search with query text in locator for other retrieval, reanalyse with a known version id for
specific missed interpretation. Explicit blocking evidence/world gaps require source-side basis.
Do not demand world authentication to resolve an evidence-only question. Provenance gaps use
stage=provenance and dimension=provenance. Leave resolved gaps out; resolve only named existing
gaps with a quote and rationale. This response is a COMPLETE replacement for the current
material's prior Analysis: re-emit every still-grounded finding and omit only findings that the
current source/context no longer supports. Never return a partial delta.
"""

VERIFY_PROMPT = DATA_RULE + """Return TWO distinct assessments of the unchanged target.
evidence_verdict: supported/contradicted/conflicting/unresolved according to evidence_scope.
If evidence_scope is nonempty, every basis quote for a non-unresolved evidence judgement must
come from those version_ids. A quotation from a scoped document can establish entailment or
contradiction without independent real-world authentication. If scoped versions are unavailable,
return unresolved and request those records. If evidence_scope is empty, use all visible materials.
world_verdict: whether the actual-world claim is independently established at as_of. Unauthenticated
fictional publisher assertions do not establish real-world events. Use world_basis and world_rationale.
The legacy verdict field must equal evidence_verdict; rationale explains that evidence judgement.
A downstream paraphrase is not independent confirmation of the record it cites, and cannot
override the scoped record when assessing what that record says.
Gaps must use stage=verification and dimension=evidence or world, name target_id and a concrete
action/locator, and explain what possible result could change the affected assessment. Blocking
gaps require a visible source quote. World-only gaps never block evidence entailment. Resolve only
existing verification gaps. Do not invent a new gap merely because a new round is available.
Every gap already present in context.gaps remains active and queued automatically. Do not copy,
restate or rewrite an existing gap in gaps; close it only through resolutions. Use a fresh ID only
for a genuinely distinct new task.
Output both layered verdicts explicitly, never null. No probability or confidence inflation.
