# Changelog

All notable changes to Accuracy Tracing are documented here. The project uses
semantic versioning for its public releases.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-06

### Highlights

- Added the staged validation loop: seven single-responsibility semantic stages
  with deterministic Python validation and judgement assembly.
- Added bounded retrieval feedback with exact task attribution, immutable
  material versions, reanalysis of affected history, and explicit stop reasons.
- Added fail-closed target grounding for actors, actions, objects, quantities,
  time scopes, negation, comparisons, and cross-event conflicts.
- Added the frozen Historical 2023 comparison harness with cutoff enforcement,
  gold isolation, raw call traces, resource accounting, and offline scoring.
- Expanded evaluation, repair, release, provenance, and staged semantic
  regression coverage to 250 passing tests.

### Observed pilot result

On the frozen two-case post-hoc pilot, the original monolithic adapter scored
1/2 and the staged adapter scored 2/2. The staged arm used 5.5× as many calls
and 3.17× as many total tokens. A separate full-evidence diagnostic failed in
the staged arm, so the run-level status is `has_errors` even though all scored
main cases completed. See the
[full report](reports/historical-2023-pilot2-v3-live-001/SUMMARY.md).

This small pilot is an engineering signal, not a general accuracy estimate or
an equal-compute causal result.

### Compatibility

- Python 3.11 or newer.
- The core package remains standard-library-only.
- Model-backed experiments use the optional `model` dependency group and run
  from a source checkout.
- Legacy `demo`, `verify`, and `benchmark` commands remain available.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-05

- Introduced the bounded provenance trace engine and fixed-target evaluation
  toolkit.
- Added immutable evidence versions, lineage-aware source grouping,
  reanalysis, explicit budgets, and deterministic offline fixtures.
- Added the MIT license, packaging metadata, contribution guide, and CI.
