# v0.3 repair and migration contract

This document supersedes conflicting v0.2 adapter/implementation notes. The legacy policy runner and seven-metric arithmetic evaluator remain available. Historical v0.2 reports are retained as historical records.

## Fixed question and layered assessments

`Target` adds `assessment_mode="world"` and `evidence_scope=()`. Evidence mode asks what the named document versions support or contradict; world mode asks whether the actual event is established. Source originality and truth remain separate questions. An empty evidence scope uses all eligible material. Dict inputs may use a JSON array for the scope; the engine normalizes it to an immutable tuple.

`VerificationResult` preserves the five old positional fields and adds `evidence_verdict`, `world_verdict`, `world_basis`, and `world_rationale`. Legacy plugins may omit the new fields; their old verdict is used for both raw assessments. The supplied model adapter always returns both explicitly and keeps the legacy `verdict` equal to its evidence verdict. A positive world judgment requires its own exact evidence basis and explanation. This is structural validation, not a programmatic proof that a model's semantic judgment is true.

The report adds `assessments`, `decision_status`, and `assessment_valid`. `assessments[dimension]` stores `raw_verdict`, the gated `decision`, and `blocking_gap_ids`. `fact_status` continues to describe the world decision. Evidence findings are preserved when world verification remains unknown. `decision_status` follows the fixed target assessment mode. Errors invalidate final decision presentation while retaining prior audited findings.

Use `newsverify.decisions.present_decision(report)` for every compared variant. `round_decisions(report)` exposes actual completed-round checkpoints using the same label mapping. Neither function calls a model or invents confidence probabilities. Changing assessment mode means changing the task and requires separate gold labels; it is not a way to repair an old score after seeing predictions.

## Gaps have scope and executable actions

`Gap` adds dimension (`provenance`, `evidence`, `world`, or legacy `auto`), a boolean `blocking`, optional `target_id`, exact `basis`, `decision_impact`, action (`fetch`, `search`, `reanalyse`), optional `locator`, and optional persistent `probe_id` for staged target obligations.

Only blocking gaps for the relevant dimension affect its decision. Explicit blocking evidence/world gaps need an actual source basis and a stated possible effect on the decision. Gaps for another target are rejected. A gap keeps an immutable lifecycle identity (stage, dimension, target, action, locator and probe), and its blocking severity is monotonic for the lifetime of that ID—even after closure. Close it with an evidenced `Resolution`; use a new ID for a genuinely different or weaker task. A staged unavailable receipt or resolution applies only to the exact persisted probe. Across current material owners, committed gap/resolution events are ordered by analysis revision, so a newer explicit reopen beats an older closure and a newer closure beats an older open. The semantic adapter is responsible for judging relevance; merely citing text cannot prove that a gap is material.

`SnapshotSearchProvider` executes fetches against exact URLs/version IDs, query search against the supplied index, and explicit reanalysis of previously returned versions. It prioritizes constrained exact obligations, credits one returned version to every matching task, and gives broad searches one-per-task coverage before filling spare capacity. Duplicate material/seed IDs fail closed. CJK routing uses deterministic uni/bi/trigrams. It is an offline index and makes no claim to cover the open web.

Task-aware providers should implement `search_hits` and return `RetrievalHit(material, task_ids)`. Task IDs must be unique members of that round's frozen issued set. In strict staged mode, every external return after the seed round needs this exact attribution, and provider feedback must cover every issued task with the exact six-field contract: `gap_id`, `action`, `locator`, `status`, `reason`, `version_ids`. A `returned` version set must exactly equal the observed attribution; `unavailable` and `budget_exhausted` cannot name or hide returned versions. Legacy `search` with bare `MaterialVersion` remains supported outside that strict path; its mutable attribution sidecar is frozen before iteration.

Validated receipts enter decomposition as `current_return` and verification as `current_round_returns`. A staged resolution therefore needs both a current exact task receipt and fresh basis from a version attributed to that task. A task marked `budget_exhausted` is retried while the outer budget permits; an `unavailable` task is terminal only for the fixed provider scope. A verifier-created branch from an empty retrieval round is issued in the next round instead of being lost to premature provider exhaustion.

The provider protocol remains replaceable by a live collector. A collector must return genuine captured versions and explicit availability evidence, preserve corrections under new IDs, and report its scope honestly. API credentials, web authentication and independently reviewed source trust are not inferred by this index.

## Every return and affected previous versions pass through psi

Every valid arrival is saved and decomposed before graph/verification admission. Future or unavailable versions receive an isolated archival decomposition; a stateful semantic plugin does not see them. This does not solve model pretraining contamination.

When a newly admitted upstream matches an old declared citation locator, the engine automatically schedules psi for the old source even if the model omitted `revisit_versions`. It never silently marks that citation direct. Reanalysis still requires the source-side quote and available upstream. Traversal and decomposition budgets apply. Self-revisits are audited and deduplicated; they do not create a missing-news-fact gap.

Fragments must have an acyclic parent path to the target through fragments in that analysis. `qualifier_spans` locates the exact wording carrying negation, time, quantity or scope. Human-readable paraphrases remain available in `text` and `qualifiers`.

## Progress and budgets

Evidence progress hashing includes source spans, grounded qualifier spans, relation structure, origin findings and actionable gap structure. It excludes regenerated fragment/relation IDs, free paraphrases and human qualifier prose. A gap question remains cosmetic when a locator supplies the executable query; when locator is absent, its question is part of the retrieval state. A changed source span or executable task can justify a further round; merely changing non-executable wording cannot. This is a structural proxy and still needs semantic review for whether a new relation or qualifier is meaningful.

The verifier has an input fingerprint over the immutable target, eligible material fingerprints, full verifier-visible analyses/fragments/relations/origins, active gaps and current attributed receipts. This includes fragment text and qualifiers even though cosmetic prose does not extend structural loop progress. The staged verifier also includes canonical retrieval feedback. Only an identical complete input is skipped; a new valid receipt or `unavailable` result may require one more review even if the graph structure is unchanged. Evidence and world layers cache independently, and only lifecycle-free judgements are cached—outputs containing gaps or resolutions are never replayed.

Round, material and decomposition caps remain hard limits. The optional transport separately enforces model call count, total output tokens, per-call output tokens and wall time; input tokens are measured rather than token-capped, while each staged serialized payload has a 250,000-character cap. Each staged transaction checks that its worst-case repair path fits the remaining call/output budget before making its first model call. SDK retries are disabled. An API, schema, deterministic gate, budget or integrity failure remains explicit and is retained in evaluation.

## Reproducible experiments and reuse

New validation runs default to the split adapter described in `STAGED_VALIDATION_LOOP.md`. A deterministic, target-only `TargetPlan` fixes at most eight probes and every required dimension before evidence is read. Independent conjunction branches are split, while shared qualifier/attribution scope stays together and ambiguous compounds fail closed. Supported core evidence must preserve the target's surface token/character order, which blocks simple actor/object reversal but is not a semantic theorem. The seven model stages are `atoms`, `lineage`, `decomposition_critic`, `evidence`, `evidence_critic`, `world`, and `world_critic`; Python performs the two atomic assemblies. The decomposition transaction shares one repair allowance, while evidence and world each have their own allowance shared between deterministic validation and their isolated critic. Exact probe/dimension coverage is enforced structurally, but the heuristic plan and model reviews do not prove semantic completeness or truth. The prior monolithic adapter remains available only through an explicit experiment mode for compatibility and ablation.

`experiments/inputs-v03.json` and `gold-v03.json` were frozen before inference; their hashes are in `frozen-v03.json`. They define five synthetic contract cases and one full-evidence control. All targets and all failed attempts must be retained. Inference never opens gold; scoring is a separate command.

The comparison uses the literal first-round checkpoint versus the continued run under the same mapping. It does not reexecute the original agent, and it does not claim an independent stochastic baseline. The all-materials control helps identify when an apparent loop gain comes from access to additional documents.

`--reuse-from` may reuse responses only from the same case/variant, with identical requested model, reasoning setting, prompts, payload, schema, response mode and per-call output cap. Each recorded response can be consumed at most once. Prior API IDs, token usage and wall time are retained and charged to logical budgets. Reused responses are marked; actual new API usage is reported separately. It is response replay, not a fresh model measurement. Changed requests are sent to the official API, and errors are never cached as successful answers.

## Compatibility

The report schema is now `0.3`; consumers must account for the additional assessment fields. Legacy constructors and v0.1 CLI behavior remain supported. Plugins that previously expected to see excluded future material must adapt to isolated archival decomposition. Nested fragment parents must be included in the same analysis response. Free-form qualifier changes are no longer sufficient to prolong a loop; use grounded `qualifier_spans` when the relevant source wording changes.
